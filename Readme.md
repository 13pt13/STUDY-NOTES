    Well, Without any computer foundation, after three months of groping,I finally learned to go online and establish a security isolation network. Thanks for Program-Thinking (编程随想) and many unknown authors.

    Tribute to the brave people, but i am not a political fanatic, because historical occupy an important position in modern politics, and happiness is also subjective. Do not deny all the past to the present with the status quo. In addition, anyone who wants to change the outside world from the top-level design will eventually have selfishness.


    So I created the first project on GITHUB. In order to better review the knowledge I learned and improve my english level, I will not create a second project before having enough knowledge reserves.
  


    没有任何计算机基础的我，经过3个月的摸索，终于学会了科学上网和建立安全隔离网络，在此感谢program-think(编程随想)。

    向勇敢的人致敬，但我不是一个政治狂热分子，因为历史因素在现代政治中占据了重要位置，而幸福也是主观的。切勿以现状否定过去到现在的全部，并且，任何想要从顶层设计改变外界现状的人最终都存有私心。
    

    所以我在GITHUB上创建了第一个项目，为了更好的复习我所学习过的知识, 提高我的英语水平。在拥有足够的知识储备之前，不会创建第二个项目。
